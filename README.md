## Description

Shows hidden files in a directory.

It takes a directory path as an input and lists the hidden files in that directory. The function uses the ls command with the -d option to show only the hidden files in the specified directory.

It also uses the extglob shell option to enable extended pattern matching, which allows the function to exclude certain files from the list (such as the current directory and parent directory).

## Examples

Here is how you would use the laa function to list the hidden files in the `/home/user/documents directory`:

```bash
laa /home/user/documents
```

This would show a list of all of the hidden files in the `/home/user/documents` directory. You can also pass multiple directories to the laa function to list the hidden files in multiple directories at once. For example:

```bash
laa /home/user/documents /home/user/photos
```

This would show a list of all of the hidden files in the `/home/user/documents` and `/home/user/photos` directories.
