NAME
    laa - list all hidden files in a directory

SYNOPSIS
    laa [DIRECTORY...]

DESCRIPTION
    The laa function is a shell function that lists all of the hidden files in a specified directory or directories. Hidden files are files that have names that start with a period (`.`). This function uses the ls command with the -d and -a options to show hidden files in a directory.

OPTIONS
    DIRECTORY
        This is the path to the directory or directories that you want to list the hidden files in. You can specify multiple directories by separating them with spaces. If no directory is specified, the function will list the hidden files in the current directory.

EXAMPLES
    To list the hidden files in the current directory, use the following command:
        laa

    To list the hidden files in the /home/user/documents directory, use the following command:
        laa /home/user/documents

    To list the hidden files in the /home/user/documents and /home/user/photos directories, use the following command:
        laa /home/user/documents /home/user/photos
